A Minimal CLI-based Android App Launcher.

## Installation
To contribute to this project, you would need to fork it on GitHub. After that, clone your forked repository onto your local machine and open in with Android Studio
```
git clone https://github.com/your_username/yantra-app-launcher.git
```

A `local.properties` file will be generated by Android Studio that contains all local configurations for your IDE. Add the following lines in it to specify environment variables used by Yantra Launcher:
```
weatherAPIkey="your-weather-api-key"
backupPassword="your-backup-password"
```
Leave these values as it is or feed in your weatherapi.com API key if you want to test the `weather` command.

Now you should be good to go ðŸš€...
