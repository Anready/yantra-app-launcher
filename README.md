# yantra-app-launcher
A Minimal CLI Launcher for Android

## Installation
Clone this repo and open in Android Studio. A `local.properties` file will be generated. Add the following lines in it:
```
openWeatherApiKey="your-openweather-api-key"
licenseKey="play-store-key"
```
Leave these values blank or put in your Open Weather API key if you want to test the `weather` command

Now you should be good to go ðŸš€...
