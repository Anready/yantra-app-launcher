# yantra-app-launcher
A Minimal CLI-based Android App Launcher.

## Installation
Clone this repo and open it in Android Studio.
```
git clone https://github.com/coderGtm/yantra-app-launcher.git
```

A `local.properties` file will be generated by Android Studio that contains all local configurations for your IDE. Add the following lines in it to specify environment variables used by Yantra Launcher:
```
openWeatherAPIkey="your-openweather-api-key"
licenseKey="play-store-key.....not required...just-leave-it"
```
Leave these values as it is or feed in your Open Weather API key if you want to test the `weather` command.

Now you should be good to go ðŸš€...
